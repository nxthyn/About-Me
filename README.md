## About Me
* I am an 18 year old student of EPIC campus in Littleton Public Schools. I enjoy a variety of things including various Computer Science interests, Taekwondo, and creating/listening to music. Above all, one of my biggest passions is learning. I love the feeling of picking up a new skill or finding a new rabbit hole to explore.
* One of my biggest accomplishments was getting my 3rd Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo, and it has since motivated me to just keep working on improving my skills. It has also taught me some valuable lessons for my life, such as confidence, discipline, and leadership. These things, when combined with my interests in math and comp sci, have led me to even exploring teaching as a future career path.
### Strengths
- I am a great collaborator. I find it easy to bring the best out of people, and fostering a healthy relationship with those I work with.
### Goals
- I will sometimes get easily upset when faced with adversity when I expected something to be easy. I am working on having a more balanced/mature attitude and not letting difficulty get in the way of my effort.
- I often find myself taking breaks somewhat often when I am working on a project of some kind. I am working on keeping a longer attention span and being able to perservere through a project until it is complete.

## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* I went from knowing the bare-bones basic of the Java programming language to being able to use complex data structures and sorting/searching algorithms with ease and efficiency. My understanding of the Java programming language and even coding as a whole greatly increased over the course of the semester, and I feel like a much more developed programmer.
* My ability to document my program and communicate/collaborate with others while programming was basically non-existent before I took this course. I got lots of valuable practice working with others and I feel like I am at the very least a competent collaborator now when I am programming.

### Workforce Readiness
- With such an emphasis on workplace readiness throughout the entire school, there were many resources to improve my skills at my disposal. 

### Professional Experiences
- Work Site tours
- Job shadowing
- Conferences
- Professional Organizations
