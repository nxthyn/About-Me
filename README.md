## About Me
* I am an 18 year old student of EPIC campus in Littleton Public Schools. I enjoy a variety of things including various Computer Science interests, Taekwondo, and creating/listening to music. Above all, one of my biggest passions is learning. I love the feeling of picking up a new skill or finding a new rabbit hole to explore.
* One of my biggest accomplishments was getting my 3rd Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo, and it has since motivated me to just keep working on improving my skills. It has also taught me some valuable lessons for my life, such as confidence, discipline, and leadership. These things, when combined with my interests in math and comp sci, have led me to even exploring teaching as a future career path.
### Strengths
- I am a great collaborator. I find it easy to bring the best out of people, and fostering a healthy relationship with those I work with.
### Goals
- I will sometimes get easily upset when faced with adversity when I expected something to be easy. I am working on having a more balanced/mature attitude and not letting difficulty get in the way of my effort.
- I often find myself taking breaks somewhat often when I am working on a project of some kind. I am working on keeping a longer attention span and being able to perservere through a project until it is complete.

## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* I went from knowing the bare-bones basic of the Java programming language to being able to use complex data structures and sorting/searching algorithms with ease and efficiency. My understanding of the Java programming language and even coding as a whole greatly increased over the course of the semester, and I feel like a much more developed programmer.
* My ability to document my program and communicate/collaborate with others while programming was basically non-existent before I took this course. I got lots of valuable practice working with others and I feel like I am at the very least a competent collaborator now when I am programming.

### Workforce Readiness
- With such an emphasis on workplace readiness throughout the entire school, there were many resources to improve my skills at my disposal. My ability to stay in the uniform, be on time, communicate with others, and create a good product were all massively improved by the environment that was fostered at EPIC. I feel significantly more ready to both go to college and start my career with the skills I have picked up.

### Professional Experiences
- Work Site tours
  	- I went on a tour of System76, a computer manufacturer, and I learned more about how the floor process works in the shop, and all of the different moving parts (actual people and literal robots) that go into the process.
  	- I attended SC23, the 2023 Supercomputing conference in Denver this year. In that experience I learned more about applications of supercomputing, the basics of quantum computing, and the many fields that computer science has paired with.

## Projects: 
- Final Project - insert pitbull link
	 - "How Pitbull Is It?" is a project where a person inputs a word, and the output is a number 1-10, rating how "Pitbull" a word is based on how many times he has said it. The project was made by collecting all of Pitbull's lyrics and puttting them into a .csv file, which is then traversed every time the program runs to count.
	- I learned the basics of Web Scraping in Python and database management in mySQL in order to make my project more efficient. I did not end up using either of those skills during the final draft of the project, however they were valuable lessons to learn.
